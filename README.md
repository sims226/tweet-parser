<!-- ## **Background**
As a literature student in my twenties, I discovered Richard Brautigan, a little known poet and novelist from the post-Beat Haight-Ashbury scene in the 1960s. The first of his novels I read was *A Confederate General from Big Sur*, which included this passage, from the chapter, *"The Rivets in Ecclesiastes"* :

>I was, of course, reading Ecclesiastes at night in a very old Bible that had heavy pages. At first I read it over and over again every night, and then I read it once every night, and then I began reading just a few verses every night, and now I was just looking at the punctuation marks. Actually I was counting them, a chapter every night. I was putting the number of punctuation marks down in a notebook, in neat columns. I called the notebook "The Punctuation Marks in Ecclesiastes." I thought it was a nice title. I was doing it as a kind of study in engineering. Certainly before they build ships they know how many rivets it takes to hold the ship together and he various sizes of the rivets. I was curious about the number of rivets and the sizes of those rivets in Ecclesiastes, a dark and beautiful ship sailing on our waters.

Fast-forward to now, twenty years since discovering Brautigan, and I'm learning JavaScript. The primary purpose of this little text parsing app, then, is educational: a way for me to practice some Mendoza Line code skills like functions, loops, interacting with RESTful APIs, and so forth. Beyond that, it's also an homage to Brautigan and his affinity for the tiny structures of language. -->
