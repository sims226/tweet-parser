      <h3>By way of explanation...</h3>
      <p>In my twenties, I was mildly obsessed with Richard Brautigan, a little known poet from the post-Beat 1960s. One chapter from one of his novels really struck a nerve in me: <em>"The Rivets in Ecclesiastes"</em> from <em>A Confederate General from Big Sur</em>.</p>
      <p>Here's a sample:</p>

      <blockquote>I was, of course, reading Ecclesiastes at night in a very old Bible that had heavy pages. At first I read it over and over again every night, and then I read it once every night, and then I began reading just a few verses every night, and now I was just looking at the punctuation marks. Actually I was counting them, a chapter every night. I was putting the number of punctuation marks down in a notebook, in neat columns. I called the notebook "The Punctuation Marks in Ecclesiastes." I thought it was a nice title. I was doing it as a kind of study in engineering. Certainly before they build ships they know how many rivets it takes to hold the ship together and he various sizes of the rivets. I was curious about the number of rivets and the sizes of those rivets in Ecclesiastes, a dark and beautiful ship sailing on our waters.</blockquote>

      <p>I've often found myself distracted by such details, needled by a mentors, coaches, and bosses majoring on minor.</p>

      <p>The narrator in <em>Confederate General</em> seemed to find the same pleasure in the tiny structures of things that I did: the blades of a camera lens aperture, the springs and countersprings of Shimano derailleurs, the miraculous abstractions of language.</p>

      <p>Fast-forward a couple of decades and I find myself learning to code. This page, then, is both an indulgence to my own practice and a little homage to one of my favorite authors.</p>
